Search the longest compounded word assignment.
**NOTE**:-> This program is created by me by learning Hashset concept in Java.I have tested it in VS Code Editor.
First, the program reads all the words from the file and sorts them based on their length, so smaller words are checked first. 
Then it checks each word to see if it can be formed by combining other words in the list. It uses a HashSet to make checking faster. While processing, it keeps track of the two longest compound words.
Finally, the program shows the longest and second-longest compound words in the console. 
To run this, just put the input file (e.g., Input_01.txt) in the same folder as the program, compile it, and run it.
Make sure the input file has one word per line, and the words are sorted alphabetically.
I have learnt and implemented this program as simple, beginner-friendly, and shows a clear approach to solving the problem.
Hopefully you would consider it.
Thanking you
